# DailyLogAndTracker

This app was made to track the calories and nutritional value of the food items using an AI LLM and also keep track or keep logs of any projects that the user wishes to do on a daily or a weekly basis.
I made this app primarily to learn key concepts of coding.

practices like:-
*Flat UI Design
*Multi file OOP
*API Call Handling
*RDBMS
*C# coding for app design

pls do note in the main project folder there should be a file that is name config.json which has the API KEY 
{
"GroqAPIkey" : "YOUR_KEY_HERE" //API Key From groq
}
which is not there in the project to protect the api key
